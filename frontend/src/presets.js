  "NOT count — the house must put the blame on one of the five.\n" +

  "1) A loud argument was heard near midnight; two voices, one was Ramesh, " +
  "the other unclear.\n" +
  "2) A cash bundle Ramesh kept in the house is missing.\n" +
  "3) A glass was smashed in the hallway; no one admits who broke it.\n" +

  "secrets may later be revealed to the whole house by the producer. " +
